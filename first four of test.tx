size of original stream: 32 bits (4 bytes)
"test"

convert to bytes:
01110100 01100101 01110011 01110100

append all bytes into a single 32 bit value:
01110100011001010111001101110100

convert to a decimal number:
1952805748

factor by prime table starting with highest prime:
1952805748/43
45414087
45414087/43
1056141
1056141/43
24561
24561/43
571
571/43
13

arrange the prime divisors starting with the remainder using their position in
the table of primes:
"7 15 15 15 15 15"

apply run length encoding by writing the number of times the value occurs
consecutively and then the value from the string;
"1 7 5 15"

convert the four numbers back to binary:
"0001 0111 0101 1111"

collate the bits into a file
0001011101011111

size of output: 16 bits
compression rate of 50%

if there is a prime number (can't be factored), the leading four bits are all
zeroes and the prime number is left as a 32 bit value.
